**Parkinson's Disease Diagnosis using Voice Measurements**

--This project uses machine learning to classify individuals as healthy or having Parkinson's disease based on a dataset of biomedical voice measurements.
--The analysis explores various classification techniques to determine the most effective method for distinguishing between the two groups.

**Project Overview**
--The goal of this project is to address the challenge of Parkinson's disease diagnosis by leveraging a dataset of voice measurements.
--The notebook provides a comprehensive step-by-step analysis, from initial data exploration to the implementation and evaluation of various classification models.

**Dataset**
--The dataset contains a range of biomedical voice measurements and a target attribute indicating the health status of the individuals (healthy or with Parkinson's disease). 
--It includes 22 attributes for 195 voice recordings.

**Methodology**
--Data Loading & Preprocessing: The dataset is loaded and prepared for analysis. This includes checking for missing values and ensuring data integrity.

**Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
--Initial analysis is performed to understand the dataset, including visualizing the distribution of healthy individuals versus those with Parkinson's disease using a pie chart.

**Statistical Analysis:**
--Statistical methods are used to identify key features and relationships within the data.

**Model Building:**
--The dataset is split into training and testing sets, and multiple classification models are trained.

**Models Used**
The following machine learning algorithms are implemented and evaluated:

**Decision Tree Classifier:** A tree-based model for classification.

**Logistic Regression:** A linear model for binary classification.

**K-Means Clustering:** An unsupervised learning algorithm used here for classification purposes to group similar data points.
